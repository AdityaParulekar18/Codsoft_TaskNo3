TASK 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This C++ program implements a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns to make moves on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winning condition, a draw, and allows players to play again after the game concludes.

-->Features:
1. Game Board: Represents the Tic-Tac-Toe grid using a 2D vector with 'X' and 'O' symbols.
2. Display Board Function: Visualizes the current state of the game board after each move.
3. Move Validation: Checks for valid moves, preventing players from choosing already occupied positions or entering out-of-range values.
4. Winning Condition Check: Detects if a player has won either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. Draw Check: Identifies a draw when all positions on the board are filled, and no player has won.
6. Play Again Option: After a game concludes, the program asks if players want to play again.
7. Reset Board: Resets the game board for a new round.
